In this blog post, I'll explore an efficient way to deploy multiple Azure OpenAI instances with multiple models using Terraform. Azure OpenAI provides powerful artificial intelligence capabilities, including natural language processing and machine learning models.

## Introduction to Azure OpenAI
Azure OpenAI is a cloud-based service offered by Microsoft Azure that enables developers and data scientists to build and deploy cutting-edge artificial intelligence models. It provides a wide range of AI capabilities, including natural language understanding, sentiment analysis, text translation, image recognition, and more. Azure OpenAI leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to enable sophisticated AI-driven applications and solutions.

### Azure OpenAI vs. OpenAI: What's the Difference?
While both Azure OpenAI and OpenAI are related to artificial intelligence, they serve different purposes. OpenAI is an independent research organization focused on developing advanced AI models and technologies. On the other hand, Azure OpenAI is a cloud service provided by Microsoft Azure that integrates OpenAI's models and technologies into the Azure ecosystem. Azure OpenAI enables users to leverage OpenAI's models easily and integrate them into their own applications and workflows within the Azure cloud environment.

## The Challenge: Deploying Multiple Models to Multiple Cognitive Accounts

During our testing phase, I encountered the challenge of deploying multiple models to multiple Azure OpenAI cognitive accounts. Manually creating and configuring each cognitive account and deployment model individually through the Azure portal GUI was a tedious and error-prone process. 

Similarly, defining multiple resource blocks in Terraform for each cognitive deployment account was not an ideal solution either. It would result in repetitive code and decreased maintainability.

I needed a better way to automate this process.

## The Solution: Nesting Loops with Terraform and Locals

To overcome these challenges, I leveraged the power of Terraform and its ability to nest loops using locals. By defining a nested loop structure, I was able to create a clean and efficient solution.

### Separating Files and Structure

To keep our Terraform code organized and modular, I separated it into multiple files. Here's an overview of our file structure:

- `main.tf`: This file contains the main Terraform configuration, including the resource definitions and the nested loop structure.

- `locals.tf`: This file defines the locals used in our Terraform code, including the nested loop for cognitive deployments.

- `variables.tf`: This file defines the input variables used in our Terraform code, such as the deployments data structure.

- `dev.tfvars`: This environment-specific file contains the values for the variables defined in `variables.tf`. It allows us to have different configurations for different environments (e.g., dev, prod).

### Terraform Code Details

Here's an overview of the Terraform code used to automate the deployment of Azure OpenAI cognitive accounts and models:

```hcl
# main.tf

locals {
  cognitive_deployments = flatten([
    for deployment, values in var.deployments : [
      for model in values.models : {
        deployment_name        = deployment
        cognitive_account_id  = azurerm_cognitive_account.AzureOAI[deployment].id
        model_name            = model
      }
    ]
  ])
}

resource "azurerm_cognitive_deployment" "jet-dev-gpt-deployment" {
  for_each = { for idx, dep in local.cognitive_deployments : idx => dep }

  cognitive_account_id = each.value.cognitive_account_id
  name                 = each.value.deployment_name

  model {
    format  = "OpenAI"
    name    = each.value.model_name
    version = "0301"
  }

  scale {
    type = "Standard"
  }

  timeouts {}
}
```

In this code, we define a local variable `cognitive_deployments` that uses nested loops to generate a flattened list of cognitive deployment configurations. For each deployment in the `var.deployments` data structure, we iterate over its models and create a configuration object with the deployment name, cognitive account ID, and model name.

We then use the `for_each` meta-argument to iterate over the `cognitive_deployments` list and create a separate `azurerm_cognitive_deployment` resource block for each configuration. This allows us to dynamically create a cognitive deployment resource for each model in each deployment.

### Benefits and Making the Code DRY
By using nested loops and locals, we achieved several benefits. First, we eliminated the need for repetitive resource blocks and reduced code duplication. Second, we improved maintainability by centralizing the deployment logic and reducing the chances of human error. Finally, our solution significantly reduced deployment time, allowing us to scale efficiently.

In conclusion, leveraging Terraform's nested loops with locals provided a powerful and efficient solution for deploying multiple Azure OpenAI instances with multiple models. By automating the deployment process, we saved time, reduced errors, and improved maintainability. Now, we can focus on exploring the potential of Azure OpenAI without being weighed down by manual setup.

Happy Terraforming!

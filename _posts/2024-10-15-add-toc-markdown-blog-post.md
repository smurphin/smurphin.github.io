A well-structured table of contents (TOC) can significantly enhance the readability of your documents, especially when dealing with lengthy or technical content. I often find myself writing extensive posts that benefit from a clear TOC. However, manually creating and maintaining these TOCs can be tedious and time-consuming.

   and so on;

   Simply insert the line

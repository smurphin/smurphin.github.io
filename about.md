I’m a network, security and cloud infrastructure specialist with over 24 years of experience in the IT industry. In my early career, I focused on network and security, with expertise in designing and implementing secure network architectures for organisations of all sizes.

Over the past 5 years, I’ve shifted my focus towards cloud infrastructure, particularly AWS and some GCP. I’ve worked on a wide range of projects, from deploying AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) and working with Direct Connect, to using Terraform to automate AWS environment deployment and configuring on-prem networking devices with Ansible. I’ve also implemented Zscaler ZIA and ZPA, leveraging APIs and Terraform to automate and streamline the deployment process.

I’m particularly passionate about automation and leveraging AI to improve productivity and reduce operational overhead. I’ve worked with Okta to develop automation workflows, managing our instance as Infrastrcture as Code (IaC) and have collaborated on integrating AI chatbots into Slack using Confluence, Slack & Google docs data to provide real-time support to end-users.

Throughout my career, I’ve maintained a strong interest in emerging technologies, attending conferences, tech talks, and networking events to stay up-to-date with the latest industry developments. I maintain a technology radar and a tech stack to keep track of emerging trends and technologies in the industry, which I regularly share with colleagues.

On a personal level, I’m an avid endurance athlete and have completed several triathlons, including the Helvellyn triathlon twice. I recently completed my first ultra trail run of 40 miles and have planned to participate in the London Marathon and the Suffolk Backyard Ultra later this year.

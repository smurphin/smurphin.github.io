# About Me

I'm a network, security, and cloud infrastructure specialist with over 24 years of experience in the IT industry. I'm passionate about automation and using AI to improve productivity. I maintain a technology radar and regularly attend industry events to stay up-to-date. Through this blog, I share my knowledge and experience on cloud infrastructure, emerging technologies, and their practical applications in the IT industry.

## Early Career

In my early career, I focused on network and security, with expertise in designing and implementing secure network architectures for organizations of all sizes.

## Cloud Infrastructure

Over the past 7 years, I've shifted my focus towards cloud infrastructure, particularly AWS and some GCP. I've worked on a wide range of projects, from deploying AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) and working with Direct Connect, to using Terraform to automate AWS environment deployment and configuring on-prem networking devices with Ansible. I've also implemented Zscaler ZIA and ZPA, leveraging APIs and Terraform to automate and streamline the deployment process.

## Automation and AI

I'm particularly passionate about automation and leveraging AI to improve productivity and reduce operational overhead. I've investigated options with Okta and Zscaler to develop automation workflows, moving towards managing our deployments as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and have collaborated on integrating AI chatbots into Slack using Confluence, Slack and Google docs data to provide real-time support to end-users.

## Emerging Technologies

Throughout my career, I've maintained a strong interest in emerging technologies, attending conferences, tech talks, and networking events to stay up-to-date with the latest industry developments. I maintain a technology radar and a tech stack to keep track of emerging trends and technologies in the industry, which I regularly share with colleagues.

## Personal Interests

On a personal level, I'm an avid endurance athlete and have completed several triathlons, including the Helvellyn triathlon twice. I recently completed my first ultra trail run of 40 miles, completed the London Marathon and ran the Suffolk Backyard Ultra this year.
